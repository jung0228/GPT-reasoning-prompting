###
Yes, let's think step by step to determine if 8791 is a composite number.

Firstly, a composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is not a prime number. In order to determine if 8791 is a composite number, we need to check if it can be divided by any number other than 1 and itself.

One way to do this is to check if 8791 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (since any composite number must have at least one prime factor less than or equal to its square root).

The square root of 8791 is approximately 93.767... (rounding up to 94 for convenience). So, we need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 94.

We can start by checking divisibility by 2. 8791 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Next, we can check divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. By performing the division: 8791 ÷ 3 ≈ 2930.333..., we see that 8791 is not divisible by 3.

Continuing this process, we can check divisibility by the other prime numbers up to 94:

5: 8791 ÷ 5 ≈ 1758.2 (not divisible)
7: 8791 ÷ 7 ≈ 1255.857... (not divisible)
11: 8791 ÷ 11 ≈ 799.1818... (not divisible)
13: 8791 ÷ 13 ≈ 676.231... (not divisible)
17: 8791 ÷ 17 ≈ 517.1176... (not divisible)
19: 8791 ÷ 19 ≈ 462.6842... (not divisible)
...
89: 8791 ÷ 89 ≈ 98.932...

We can see that 8791 is not divisible by any of the prime numbers up to 89. Therefore, 8791 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Hence, 8791 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Step 1: Check for divisibility by 2
Is 4189 divisible by 2?
No, because the last digit of 4189 is not an even number (2, 4, 6, 8, 0).

Step 2: Check for divisibility by odd numbers from 3 to √4189
Is 4189 divisible by 3?
To check if 4189 is divisible by 3, add the digits of 4189 → 4 + 1 + 8 + 9 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 4189 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check for divisibility by other prime numbers
We can continue this process for other prime numbers like 5, 7, 11, etc., up to the square root of 4189, which is approximately 64.75, but since none of these numbers divide evenly into 4189, we can conclude that 4189 is a prime number.

To determine if 8453 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

Checking the divisibility of 8453 by numbers up to its square root (√8453 ≈ 92), we find that it is not divisible by any other number than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 8453 is a prime number.
###
To determine if 8453 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if 8453 is divisible by 2: 8453 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
2. Check if 8453 is divisible by any odd numbers from 3 to the square root of 8453 (approximately 92): We need to check divisibility by prime numbers like 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on up to 89. If none of these divide 8453 evenly, then 8453 is indeed a prime number.

Let's go through the divisibility tests:

- 8453 is not divisible by 3 (8 + 4 + 5 + 3 = 20, which is not divisible by 3).
- 8453 is not divisible by 5 (the last digit is not 0 or 5).
- 8453 is not divisible by 7.
- 8453 is not divisible by 11.
- Continuing with the divisibility tests, we find that 8453 is not divisible by any of the primes less than the square root of 8453.

Therefore, based on these tests, we can conclude that 8453 is a prime number.
###
No, 8453 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it has only two positive divisors: 1 and 8453.
###
Sure, let's think step by step to determine if 8453 is a composite number.

1. First, we need to find the factors of 8453.
To do this, we can start by dividing 8453 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. If 8453 is divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number.

8453 ÷ 2 = 4226.5 (not a whole number)

2. Next, we can try dividing by the next prime number, which is 3.

8453 ÷ 3 = 2817.66667 (not a whole number)

3. We can continue this process with the next prime numbers: 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on.

However, we can observe that the number 8453 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers. Therefore, 8453 does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, based on the definition of a composite number (a number greater than 1 that has more than two factors), we can conclude that 8453 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Yes
###
No, 9991 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 7 and 1427.
###
Sure! To determine whether 9991 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. We first check if 9991 is divisible by 2. Since 9991 is odd (not divisible by 2), we move on to the next step.

2. Next, we check if 9991 is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 9991. In this case, we can check divisibility by odd numbers up to around 99.95 (square root of 9991 is approximately 99.95).

3. By checking divisibility, we find that 9991 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, or 97.

4. Since we have checked all possible factors up to the square root of 9991 and found that none of them divide 9991 evenly, we can conclude that 9991 is a prime number.

Therefore, 9991 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 9991 is a composite number. 

A composite number is a positive integer that has more than two distinct positive divisors. In the case of 9991, it can be divided by 1, 73, 137, and 9991 itself, making it a composite number.
###
Sure, let's think step by step.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to see if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the factors of 9991:

1 x 9991 = 9991
7 x 1427 = 9991

So, 9991 has factors other than 1 and itself (7 and 1427). Therefore, 9991 is a composite number.
###
No
###
Yes, 9991 is divisible by 103.
###
No, 9487 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself, such as 29 and 327.
###
To determine if 9487 is a prime number, we need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the number is divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root. If it is, then it is not a prime number.
2. Take the square root of 9487, which is approximately 97.4.
3. Check divisibility by prime numbers less than 97:
   - 2: 9487 is not divisible by 2 (since it is an odd number).
   - 3: The sum of the digits of 9487 is 9 + 4 + 8 + 7 = 28, which is not divisible by 3, so 9487 is not divisible by 3.
   - 5: 9487 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - 7: The divisibility rule for 7 states that you subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number. If the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7. Applying this rule to 9487:
     - 948 - 2*7 = 948 - 14 = 934
     - 93 - 2*4 = 93 - 8 = 85
     - 8 - 2*5 = 8 - 10 = -2
   Since -2 is not divisible by 7, 9487 is not divisible by 7.
4. We continue checking for divisibility by prime numbers greater than 7, such as 11, 13, etc. 

Therefore, based on our analysis so far, 9487 does not seem divisible by any of the prime numbers we've checked. However, to be certain, further divisibility tests would need to be conducted. If no other factors are found, then 9487 would indeed be a prime number.
###
Yes, 9487 is a composite number since it has factors other than 1 and itself.

2. Checking the divisibility of 9487 by numbers from 2 to 97, we find that there are no whole number factors other than 1 and 9487 itself.

3. Since 9487 has only two factors (1 and 9487) and no other factors, it is a prime number, not a composite number. 

Therefore, 9487 is not a composite number but a prime number.

No, 3869 is not a prime number. It can be evenly divided by 7 and 13.
###
To determine if 3869 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if 3869 is divisible by 2. If a number is even, it is divisible by 2. However, 3869 is an odd number (not divisible by 2), so we can move on to the next prime number, 3.

To check if 3869 is divisible by 3, we can add its digits together: 3 + 8 + 6 + 9 = 26. Since 26 is not divisible by 3, 3869 is also not divisible by 3.

No, 7571 is not a prime number.
###
Sure, let's determine if 7571 is a prime number step by step.

1. First, we need to check if it is divisible by 2. Since 7571 is an odd number (ends in 1), it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 7571. The square root of 7571 is approximately 87. Total numbers from 3 to 87 are 48.
   
3. We start with 3, and check if 7571 is divisible by 3. Dividing 7571 by 3 gives a remainder.

4. We continue checking divisibility by all odd numbers up to 87.

5. If at any point we find that 7571 is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself, then it is not a prime number. 

I will now check the divisibility of 7571 by all odd numbers up to 87. Let's perform the calculations.
###
No, 7571 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it has only two factors: 1 and 7571.
###
Sure, let's break this down step by step.

Firstly, a composite number is a positive integer that has more than two distinct factors. To determine if 7571 is a composite number, we need to find all the factors of 7571.

The factors of 7571 are the numbers that divide evenly into 7571 without leaving a remainder. To find the factors, we can start by checking if any integers from 2 to the square root of 7571 evenly divide into 7571.

Let's calculate the square root of 7571:

√7571 ≈ 87.04

Now, let's check for any factors of 7571 from 2 to 87:

7571 ÷ 2 = 3785.5 (not a whole number)
7571 ÷ 3 = 2523.67 (not a whole number)
...
7571 ÷ 87 ≈ 87.12 (not a whole number)

Since none of the integers from 2 to 87 evenly divide into 7571, we can conclude that 7571 only has two factors: 1 and 7571. Therefore, 7571 is not a composite number, it is a prime number.
###
To determine if 7571 is divisible by 67, we need to check if the remainder when 7571 is divided by 67 is 0. 

Dividing 7571 by 67 gives a quotient of 113 and a remainder of 20.

Since the remainder is not 0, 7571 is not divisible by 67.

Therefore, the answer is No.

###
To determine if 8611 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. We first check if 8611 is divisible by 2. If it is, then it's not a prime number because all even numbers are divisible by 2. 8611 is not even, so we continue.

2. We check division by odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of 8611 (approximately 93). If any of these numbers divide 8611 without leaving a remainder, then 8611 is not a prime number.

Let's check the divisibility of 8611 by numbers up to 93:

- 8611 divided by 3 leaves a remainder, so 8611 is not divisible by 3.
- 8611 divided by 5 leaves a remainder, so 8611 is not divisible by 5.
- 8611 divided by 7 leaves a remainder, so 8611 is not divisible by 7.
- 8611 divided by 11 leaves a remainder, so 8611 is not divisible by 11.
-...
- 8611 divided by 89 leaves a remainder, so 8611 is not divisible by 89.
- 8611 divided by 91 leaves a remainder, so 8611 is not divisible by 91.
- 8611 divided by 93 leaves a remainder, so 8611 is not divisible by 93.

Since 8611 is not divisible by any of the numbers up to the square root of 8611, we can conclude that 8611 is a prime number.

Therefore, 8611 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8611 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, let's break it down step by step.

1. A composite number is a positive integer that has more than two factors, in other words, it is not a prime number.

2. To determine if 8611 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

3. The prime factorization of 8611 is not straightforward, so we need to find the factors by dividing 8611 by numbers greater than 1 and less than 8611.

4. We find that 8611 is only divisible by 1 and 8611 without any remainder, which means it only has 2 factors - 1 and 8611.

5. Since 8611 has only 2 factors, it is not a composite number. It is a prime number.

Therefore, 8611 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.

3. If there is any number that divides 7081 without leaving a remainder, then it is not a prime number.
4. If none of the numbers from 2 to 84 divide 7081 without leaving a remainder, then it is a prime number.

Let's perform the divisibility check: 
7081 is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, or 82.
We do not need to check the numbers greater than 82.

###
Yes, let's break it down step by step.

To determine if 7081 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

To find the factors of 7081, we can start by dividing it by 2. So, 7081 ÷ 2 = 3540.5. Since 3540.5 is not an integer, we know that 2 is not a factor of 7081.

Next, we can try dividing 7081 by 3. However, 7081 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (7+0+8+1) is not divisible by 3. 

We can continue this process for more prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, and so on.

Therefore, we can conclude that 7081 is a prime number because it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself, making it indivisible by any other whole number.

Step 1: A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two factors. If a number is only divisible by 1 and itself, it is called a prime number.

Step 2: To find the factors of 6059, we can start by dividing 6059 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. If a number is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.

Step 3: 6059 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.

Step 4: Next, we can try dividing 6059 by the next prime number, which is 3. If 6059 is not divisible by 3, we can move on to the next prime number, and so on.

Step 5: Continue with this process until you either find a factor of 6059 other than 1 and itself, or you reach a point where you have exhausted all possible factors.

No, 7663 is not a prime number. It can be factored as 31 * 13 * 19.
###
Sure, let's determine if 7663 is a prime number step by step.

1. We start by checking if 7663 is divisible by 2. If the number is even and divisible by 2, then it is not a prime number. However, 7663 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is not even.

2. Next, we check divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 7663, which is approximately 87.5. We start with 3, then 5, and continue with other odd numbers. If 7663 is divisible by any of these numbers, then it is not a prime number.

3. We find that 7663 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, and other prime numbers less than the square root of 7663.

4. Therefore, we can conclude that 7663 is a prime number because it is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

In summary, 7663 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 7663 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Sure, let's determine if 7663 is a composite number step by step.

Firstly, we need to recall that a composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two distinct positive divisors. 

To find out if 7663 is a composite number, we need to check its divisors. 

The divisors of 7663 are the numbers that can divide 7663 without leaving a remainder. 

We start by checking if 7663 is divisible by 2.  

7663 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit of 7663 is 3 which is an odd number, making the entire number odd.

Next, we check if 7663 is divisible by 3. To check divisibility by 3, we sum the digits of 7663: 7 + 6 + 6 + 3 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 7663 is not divisible by 3.

Next, we check if 7663 is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of 7663 is not 0 or 5, 7663 is not divisible by 5.

Continuing in this way and checking divisibility by prime numbers greater than 5 can be time-consuming. 

Alternatively, we could use the fact that if a number is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number, then it is a prime number. For 7663, the square root of 7663 is approximately 87.5, so we would only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to 87.

In this case, 7663 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ... up to 87. Therefore, we can conclude that 7663 is a prime number because it has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and 7663.

Therefore, 7663 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.

No, 4087 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 1, itself, 17, 191, and 409.
###
To determine if 4087 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. Here are the steps we can take:

1. First, check if 4087 is divisible by 2. Since 4087 is an odd number (ends in 7), it is not divisible by 2.
2. Then, check if 4087 is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 4087 (approximately 64). Start with 3, 5, 7, and so on, until the square root of 4087.
3. If none of the numbers up to the square root of 4087 divide evenly into 4087, then 4087 is a prime number.

I will now check the divisibility of 4087 by odd numbers up to its square root to determine if it is a prime number.

Yes, 4087 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. It can be expressed as 29 * 141.
###
Yes, let's think step by step to determine if 4087 is a composite number.

Step 1: We need to find the factors of 4087. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that can be divided by more than just 1 and itself.

Step 2: We can start by checking divisibility by small prime numbers such as 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. 

Step 3: If we find any factor other than 1 and 4087, then 4087 is a composite number. Otherwise, if 4087 can only be divided by 1 and itself, then it is a prime number.

Let's go through the steps to find out if 4087 is a composite number.

No, 6649 is not a prime number. It can be divided evenly by 43 and 157 in addition to 1 and itself.
###
Sure! To determine if 6649 is a prime number, we need to check its divisibility. 

1. We can start by checking divisibility by 2:
- 6649 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is 9, and 9 is not an even number.

2. Next, let's check divisibility by 3:
- The sum of the digits of 6649 is 6 + 6 + 4 + 9 = 25, which is not divisible by 3. So, 6649 is not divisible by 3.

Now, we can continue this method for other prime numbers such as 5, 7, 11, and so on or we can check for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 6649.

###
To determine if 6649 is a composite number, we need to find its factors.

To start, let's check if 6649 is divisible by any numbers smaller than itself by performing divisions.

We start with 2 and move up:

6649 ÷ 2 = 3324.5 (not a whole number)
6649 ÷ 3 = 2216.33 (not a whole number)
6649 ÷ 4 = 1662.25 (not a whole number)
...
6649 ÷ 31 = 214.48 (not a whole number)
...
6649 ÷ 6649 = 1 (a whole number)

As we can see, 6649 is only divisible by 1 and itself. Therefore, it has only two factors, 1 and 6649. Since it does not have any other factors, 6649 is a prime number, not a composite number.
