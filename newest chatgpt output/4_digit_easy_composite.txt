Sure, let's determine if 5354 is a prime number step by step.

1. **Even Number Check**: 5354 is an even number because it ends in 4. Prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves, so any even number greater than 2 is not a prime number. Therefore, 5354 is not a prime number.

2. **Divisibility Check by 3**: To check if 5354 is divisible by 3, we add up the digits of 5354 (5+3+5+4 = 17). Since 17 is not divisible by 3, 5354 is also not divisible by 3.

3. **Divisibility Check by 5**: Since 5354 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. **Divisibility Check by 7**: To check for divisibility by 7, we can use a divisibility rule. 5354 is not divisible by 7.

5. **Checking Factors from 2 to Square Root of 5354**: We can check for factors of 5354 by dividing it by prime numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of 5354, which is approximately 73.2.

When we perform these steps, we find that 5354 can be written as 2 x 2677, indicating that it has factors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 5354 is not a prime number.

In conclusion, 5354 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

2. We can start by checking if 2 is a factor of 5354. If we divide 5354 by 2, we get 2677 as the quotient. Since 2677 is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 5354.

3. Next, let's check if 3 is a factor of 5354. If we divide 5354 by 3, we also get a non-whole number as the quotient. So, 3 is not a factor of 5354.

4. We can continue this process by checking if 4, 5, 6, and so on are factors of 5354.

5. If we go through this process and find that 5354 has factors other than 1 and itself, then it is a composite number. Otherwise, if the only factors are 1 and the number itself, then it is a prime number.

So, by following this step-by-step process, we can determine if 5354 is a composite number.

###
Yes, step by step reasoning can help determine if 4145 is a composite number. 

To determine if 4145 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

1. We can start by checking if 4145 is divisible by 2. If the last digit of a number is even (like in 4145), then the entire number is divisible by 2. 

4145 is divisible by 2 because its last digit is 5 (an odd number).

1433 is not divisible by 3 without leaving a remainder, so we move on to the next prime number, which is 5. 

1433 is not divisible by 5 without leaving a remainder. 

We continue this process for the prime numbers up to the square root of 1433, which is approximately 38. 

Since none of the prime numbers up to 38 divide evenly into 1433, we can conclude that 1433 is a prime number. 

Therefore, 2866 is not a prime number, as it can be written as the product of 2 and 1433.

2. When we divide 2866 by 2, we get 1433 as the quotient, but 2866 is not divisible by 2 since it leaves a remainder.

3. Next, we try dividing by 3, 4, 5, and so on up to 53. We find that 2866 is not divisible by any of these numbers, which means it does not have any factors other than 1 and itself.

4. Since 2866 has only two factors (1 and 2866) and does not have any other factors, it is a prime number, not a composite number.

Therefore, 2866 is a prime number.

Let's check if 1589 is divisible by prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, and so on. 

If we find any factor of 1589 other than 1 and 1589 itself, then we can conclude that 1589 is a composite number. Otherwise, if 1589 is only divisible by 1 and itself, then it is a prime number.

Let's check the divisibility of 1589 by primes less than 40:
1589 is not divisible by 2.
1589 is not divisible by 3.
1589 is not divisible by 5.

The factors of 1142 are the numbers that divide evenly into 1142. 
1 x 1142 = 1142
2 x 571 = 1142

Step 2: Check if any of the factors are between 1 and 1142.
In this case, we found factors 1, 2, 571, and 1142. Since 1142 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

###
To check if 8522 is a prime number, we need to see if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step by step:

1. Check if 8522 is divisible by 2:
The sum of the digits in 8522 is 8 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 17, which is not divisible by 3. So, 8522 is not divisible by 3.
Also, the last digit of 8522 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
Therefore, 8522 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.

2. Check if 8522 has any other factors:
We can further test by dividing 8522 by prime numbers (starting from 7):
8522 ÷ 7 = 1217.4 (not an integer)
8522 ÷ 11 = 775.636363... (not an integer)
8522 ÷ 13 = 655.538461... (not an integer)
8522 ÷ 17 = 501.294117... (not an integer)

###
Sure, let's check if 4415 is a prime number step by step:

1. Check if 4415 is divisible by 2:
4415 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is odd (5).

2. Check if 4415 is divisible by 3:
4 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 14
14 is not divisible by 3, so 4415 is also not divisible by 3.

3. Check if 4415 is divisible by 5:
4415 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check if 4415 is divisible by 7:
To check for divisibility by 7, we can use the following approach:
Double the last digit of 4415, which is 5, to get 10. Subtract 10 from the rest of the number, which gives 441. Now, 44 - 1*2 = 42. Since 42 is divisible by 7, 4415 is also divisible by 7.

Therefore, 4415 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 7.
###
Yes, 4415 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###

###
To determine if 9865 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

1. First, we can check if 9865 is divisible by 2. Since 9865 is odd (not divisible by 2), we can move on to the next prime number, which is 3.

2. Next, we can check if 9865 is divisible by 3. If we add up the digits of 9865 (9 + 8 + 6 + 5 = 28), we see that the sum is not divisible by 3. Hence, 9865 is not divisible by 3.

3. We can continue this process for the next few prime numbers, such as 5, 7, 11, etc. Checking divisibility by these numbers, we see that none of them divide 9865.

Since we did not find any factors other than 1 and 9865 itself, we can conclude that 9865 is a prime number.

1. We can first check if it is even. 
   - Since the last digit is 4, 5674 is even.

2. Next, let's see if it is divisible by 3.
   - The sum of the digits of 5674 is 5 + 6 + 7 + 4 = 22, and 22 is not divisible by 3.

3. We can also check if it is divisible by 5.
   - Since the last digit is not 0 or 5, 5674 is not divisible by 5.

4. Now, let's try dividing it by prime numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 75:
   - 5674 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, or 71.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 5674 and found that none of them divides 5674 evenly, we can conclude that 5674 is not a prime number. It is a composite number.
###
Yes, 5674 is a composite number because it has more than two factors.
###
Yes, we can determine if 5674 is a composite number step by step.

1. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that can be divided evenly by more than just 1 and itself.

2. To find out if 5674 is a composite number, we need to check if it has divisors other than 1 and itself.

3. The factors of 5674 are the positive integers that divide 5674 without leaving a remainder.

4. We can start checking for factors by dividing 5674 by 2, the smallest prime number greater than 1.

5674 ÷ 2 = 2837. Since this division doesn't result in a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 5674.

5. Next, we can try dividing 5674 by 3, another prime number.

5674 ÷ 3 = 1891.333... Since this division also doesn't result in a whole number, 3 is not a factor of 5674.

6. We continue checking divisibility by the remaining prime numbers greater than 3 and less than the square root of 5674 (approximately 75). If at any point we find a whole number quotient, then we have found a factor of 5674.

After checking for more factors, we see that 5674 is not divisible by any other numbers than 1 and itself. Therefore, 5674 is a composite number.

No, 6295 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 5 and 13, among other factors.
###
Sure! To determine if 6295 is a prime number, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Check if the number is divisible by 2.
    - 6295 is not divisible by 2 (because the last digit is not 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).

Step 2: Check if the number is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 6295.
    - To save time, we can try division by 3, 5, 7, and 11 (the first few prime numbers).

Checking 6295÷3, we get 2098.33, which is not a whole number, so 6295 is not divisible by 3.
Checking 6295÷5, we get 1259, which is also not a whole number, so 6295 is not divisible by 5.
Checking 6295÷7, we get 899.29, which is not a whole number, so 6295 is not divisible by 7.
Checking 6295÷11, we get 572.27, which is not a whole number, so 6295 is not divisible by 11.

Since 6295 is not divisible by any numbers up to the square root of 6295, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 6295 is not a prime number, as it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 6295 is a composite number because it can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, to determine if 6295 is a composite number, we need to factorize it. 

First step is to find the factors of 6295. We start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 

6295 ÷ 2 = 3147.5 

Since 3147.5 is not a whole number, we move to the next smallest prime number which is 3. 

6295 ÷ 3 = 2098.33 

Again, we don't get a whole number, so we continue with the next prime number which is 5. 

6295 ÷ 5 = 1259 

Since 1259 is a prime number, we cannot divide it further.

Therefore, 6295 is a composite number as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

2. Next, we can divide 5702 by 2 to see how many times it is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder:
   5702 ÷ 2 = 2851

3. Since 5702 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number because prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves. So, 5702 is not a prime number.

Therefore, 5702 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 5702 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Sure, let's think step by step to determine if 5702 is a composite number.

Step 1: A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. In other words, a composite number has more than two factors.

Step 2: To find the factors of 5702, we need to check if any integers from 2 to 5702 (excluding 1 and 5702) divide 5702 without leaving a remainder.

Step 3: Let's start by checking if 2 is a factor of 5702. When we divide 5702 by 2, we get 2851 with a remainder of 0. Therefore, 2 is a factor of 5702.

Step 4: Since 5702 has factors other than 1 and itself (2 and 2851), we can conclude that 5702 is a composite number.

So, yes, 5702 is a composite number.

Sure, let's think step by step to determine if 5462 is a prime number.

1. Check if the number is divisible by 2:
5462 is even because it ends in a 2, so it is divisible by 2.

2. Check if the number is divisible by 3:
Add the digits of 5462: 5 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 17
17 is not divisible by 3, so 5462 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check if the number is divisible by 5:
5462 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check for divisibility by other prime numbers:
We can proceed to check if it is divisible by other prime numbers, but since 5462 is divisible by 2, we can conclude that 5462 is not a prime number.

Therefore, 5462 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.

###
Yes, let's break it down step by step to determine if 5462 is a composite number.

1. The first step is to find the factors of 5462. We can start by dividing 5462 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

5462 ÷ 2 = 2731

2. Next, we continue dividing the result by prime numbers until we either reach a prime number greater than the square root of 5462 or a factor of 5462.

After further dividing, we find that 5462 is the product of 2 and 2731. Since 2 is a prime number and 2731 is greater than the square root of 5462, we can conclude that 5462 is a composite number.

Therefore, 5462 is a composite number as it can be factored into 2 and 2731, both of which are integers other than 1 and 5462.

No, 2078 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 2, 7, 13, and 79.
###
To determine if 2078 is a prime number, we first need to identify its factors. 

Step 1: Find the factors of 2078.

The factors of 2078 are the numbers that can be multiplied together to give 2078. One way to find the factors is to divide 2078 by numbers starting from 2 and going up to the square root of 2078 which is approximately 45.54. If any division results in a whole number, then those two numbers are factors. 

2078 ÷ 2 = 1039
2078 ÷ 3 = 692.67 (not a whole number)
2078 ÷ 4 = 519.5 (not a whole number)
2078 ÷ 5 = 415.6 (not a whole number)
...
2078 ÷ 45 = 46.1777 (not a whole number)
2078 ÷ 46 = 45.1739 (not a whole number)

Step 2: Since we didn't find any other whole number factors of 2078 besides 1 and 2078 itself, we can conclude that 2078 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

Therefore, 2078 is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 2078 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Yes, let's think step by step. 

To determine if 2078 is a composite number, we need to see if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 2 is a factor of 2078. If the last digit of a number is even, then the number itself is even and divisible by 2. In this case, 2078 ends in 8, so it is indeed divisible by 2.

Next, we can perform the division: 2078 ÷ 2 = 1039. Since 2 is a factor of 2078 and the division resulted in a whole number (1039), we know that 2 is a factor of 2078.

Therefore, 2078 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself (2 and 1039).

No, 3134 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 2, 31, and 101.
###
To determine whether 3134 is a prime number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's find the square root of 3134:

√3134 ≈ 56.03

Next, we can check if 3134 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 56 (since the largest possible factor will be less than or equal to the square root of 3134).

We start by dividing 3134 by 2, but 3134 is not divisible by 2. Then we continue checking with prime numbers up to the square root of 3134.

3134 is divisible by 2, which means 3134 is not a prime number.

Therefore, 3134 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and itself (2 and 1567).
###
Yes, 3134 is a composite number. 

To determine if a number is composite or not, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. In the case of 3134, it can be factored as 2 x 1567. Since 3134 has factors other than 1 and itself, it is a composite number.
###
Sure, let's determine if 3134 is a composite number step by step.

1. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two distinct positive divisors. In other words, a number is composite if it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and itself.

2. To check if 3134 is a composite number, we need to find its factors, or divisors.

3. The factors of 3134 are the numbers that divide evenly into 3134 without leaving a remainder. These factors include 1, 2, 7, 14, 223, 446, 1567, and 3134.

4. Since 3134 has more than two distinct positive divisors (1 and itself), namely 2, 7, 14, 223, 446, 1567, and 3134, it is a composite number.

Therefore, 3134 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.

1. Check divisibility by 2:
3957 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is odd.

2. Check divisibility by odd numbers less than the square root of 3957:
To determine if 3957 is divisible by any odd number less than the square root of 3957 (approximately 62.85), we need to check division by 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on up to 61.

3. 3957 is not divisible by 3:
3 + 9 + 5 + 7 = 24, which is not divisible by 3.

4. Continue this process for other odd numbers up to 61:
We can confirm that 3957 is not divisible by 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, or 61.

6395 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is not even. 

Next, we can try to divide 6395 by the next prime number, 3. The sum of the digits of 6395 is 6+3+9+5=23, which is not divisible by 3. 

Now, we can check if 6395 is divisible by the next prime number, 5. Since 6395 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. 

We continue checking other prime numbers, and if we do not find any factors between 2 and the square root of 6395, then 6395 is a prime number. 

Therefore, based on the step-by-step analysis, 6395 is a prime number.

To check if 1461 is a prime number, we need to divide it by all numbers from 2 to the square root of 1461, which is approximately 38.24. If 1461 is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, then it is not a prime number.

Let's start by checking if 1461 is divisible by 2: 
1461 ÷ 2 = 730.5

Since 1461 divided by 2 is not a whole number, we can conclude that 1461 is not divisible by 2. Therefore, we can move on and check the divisibility by the next prime number, which is 3.

Let's check if 1461 is divisible by 3:
1 + 4 + 6 + 1 = 12, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 1461 is divisible by 3.

Since 1461 is divisible by 3, we can determine that it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 1461 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Find the factors of 1461. 
To do this, we can start by dividing 1461 by small prime numbers. If we find any factor other than 1 and 1461 itself, then we can say that 1461 is a composite number. 

Let's start by dividing 1461 by 2: 
1461 ÷ 2 = 730.5 (not a whole number)

So, 2 is not a factor of 1461. 

Now, let's try dividing by 3: 
1461 ÷ 3 = 487 (a whole number)

Since 3 is a factor of 1461, we have found a factor other than 1 and 1461 itself. Therefore, 1461 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###

No, 9098 is not a prime number. It is an even number and can be divided by 2.
###
To determine if 9098 is a prime number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Find the factors of 9098.
Factors of 9098 are pairs of numbers that multiply together to give 9098.
9098 = 1 x 9098
9098 = 2 x 4549
9098 = 43 x 211

Step 2: Check the factors.
Since 9098 has factors other than 1 and itself (2, 43, 211, 4549), it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 9098 is not a prime number because it can be divided by other numbers besides 1 and itself.
###
Yes, 9098 is a composite number because it can be divided by numbers other than 1 and itself.
###
Sure, let's break it down step by step to determine if 9098 is a composite number.

First, we need to check if 9098 is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.

The factors of 9098 are the numbers that divide 9098 without leaving a remainder. We'll start by checking if 2 is a factor of 9098.
If we divide 9098 by 2, we get:

9098 ÷ 2 = 4549

Since the result is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 9098.

Next, we can try dividing 9098 by 3:
9098 ÷ 3 = 3032.666...

Again, the result is not a whole number, so 3 is not a factor of 9098.

We continue this process with the remaining integers, but we can already conclude that 9098 is not a prime number. Therefore, 9098 is indeed a composite number, as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

No, 6145 is not a prime number. It can be divided by 5 and 7, meaning it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 6145 is a prime number, let's follow these steps:

1. Check if 6145 is divisible by 2:
6145 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is not even (5).

2. Check if 6145 is divisible by 3:
The sum of the digits of 6145 is 16, which is not divisible by 3, so 6145 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check if 6145 is divisible by 5:
6145 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.

Since 6145 is divisible by 5, it is not a prime number.
###
Yes, 6145 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Sure! To determine if 6145 is a composite number, we first need to understand what a composite number is.

A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two distinct positive divisors, in other words, a composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.

Now, let's see if 6145 fits this definition.

Firstly, we can check if 6145 is divisible by any prime number less than its square root, which is approximately 78.4 (since the square root of 6145 is around 78.4).

Checking for divisibility:
- 6145 is not divisible by 2 (because it is not even).
- 6145 is not divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 6+1+4+5=16, is not divisible by 3).
- 6145 is not divisible by 5 (because it does not end with 0 or 5).

So, so far, we have not found any factors for 6145 other than 1 and 6145 itself. This means that 6145 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Therefore, 6145 is not a composite number, it is a prime number.

No, 6638 is not a prime number. It can be factored as 2 x 3319.
###
Sure, let's determine if 6638 is a prime number step by step.

1. Check divisibility by 2: 6638 is not divisible by 2 because the last digit is not even.

2. Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 6638 is 6 + 6 + 3 + 8 = 23, which is not divisible by 3. So, 6638 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check divisibility by 5: 6638 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check divisibility by 7: We can perform the divisibility test for 7, but it is not straightforward. From the divisibility rule for 7, we can check if 6638 - 2 * 3 = 6632 is divisible by 7. If 6632 is divisible by 7, then 6638 is also divisible by 7. Since 6632 is not divisible by 7, we can conclude that 6638 is also not divisible by 7.

5. Check divisibility by other prime numbers greater than 7: We don't need to check divisibility by prime numbers greater than 7 because if a number is not divisible by the primes less than its square root, then it is also not divisible by prime numbers greater than its square root.

Therefore, we have checked the divisibility of 6638 by the prime numbers up to the square root of 6638 (which is approximately 81), and we found that 6638 is not divisible by any of them. So, we can conclude that 6638 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 6638 is a composite number.
###
Step 1: To determine if 6638 is a composite number, we need to find its factors.

Step 2: We can start by checking for factors between 2 and the square root of 6638 because any factor beyond the square root would have a corresponding factor less than the square root.

Step 3: The square root of 6638 is approximately 81.49, so we only need to check for factors up to 81.

Step 4: Let's start by checking if 6638 is divisible by 2. 6638 divided by 2 equals 3319, which is not a whole number.

Step 5: Next, we check if 6638 is divisible by 3. 6638 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (6+6+3+8) is 23, which is not divisible by 3.

Step 6: Continuing to check for factors up to 81, we find that 6638 is not divisible by 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or any other numbers.

Step 7: Since we did not find any factors other than 1 and 6638 itself, we can conclude that 6638 is a prime number, not a composite number.

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
8278 is not divisible by 2 since the last digit is not even (even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8).

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
To check divisibility by 3, add the digits of 8278: 8 + 2 + 7 + 8 = 25. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, 8278 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
8278 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Step 4: Check divisibility by 7
To check divisibility by 7, you can use a rule that involves pairs of digits. First, double the last digit of 8278 to get 16. Then, subtract this from the number formed by the tens and hundreds digits: 827 - 16*2 = 795. Since 795 is not divisible by 7, 8278 is not divisible by 7.

Since we have checked several possible divisors and found that 8278 is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 8278 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 8278 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. In this case, the factors of 8278 are 2, 11, 13, 29, and 31.
###
Sure! 
To determine if 8278 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can check if 8278 is divisible by any integers other than 1 and 8278.

We can start by trying to divide 8278 by 2. However, 8278 is an odd number, and we know that odd numbers are not divisible by 2.

Next, we can try to divide 8278 by the next few prime numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, etc.) to see if it has any factors.

If we continue to test these prime numbers and find that none of them divide evenly into 8278, then 8278 is a prime number. Otherwise, if we find any factors other than 1 and 8278, then 8278 is a composite number.

Let's check step by step whether 8278 is a prime or composite number.

1. Find the square root of 6826:
   √6826 ≈ 82.66

2. Check for divisibility by numbers from 2 up to the square root of 6826:
   - 6826 is divisible by 2, as 6826 ÷ 2 = 3413
   - It is not divisible by any other number up to 82.66.

3. Since 6826 is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, 6826 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2 and 3413.
###
Yes, 6826 is a composite number. 

A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that can be divided evenly by at least one number other than 1 and itself. In the case of 6826, it can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and 6826, such as 2, 11, 31, and 221.
###
A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two factors. To determine if 6826 is a composite number, we need to find its factors.

The factors of 6826 are the numbers that divide evenly into 6826. An easy way to find the factors is to divide 6826 by all numbers up to its square root, which is approximately 82.6.

Let's start dividing 6826 by smaller numbers to see if any of them produce a whole number quotient:

6826 ÷ 2 = 3413
6826 ÷ 3 = 2275.33 (not a whole number)
6826 ÷ 4 = 1706.5 (not a whole number)
6826 ÷ 5 = 1365.2 (not a whole number)
6826 ÷ 6 = 1137.67 (not a whole number)

We can see that 6826 is divisible by 2, 3413 times. Since 6826 has factors other than 1 and itself (2 and 3413), it is a composite number.

Therefore, 6826 is a composite number.

No, 7858 is not a prime number.
###
To determine if 7858 is a prime number, we first need to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself.

1. Check for divisibility by 2:  
7858 is not divisible by 2 because it does not end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

2. Check for divisibility by 3:  
To check for divisibility by 3, we sum the digits of 7858:  
7 + 8 + 5 + 8 = 28  
28 is not divisible by 3, so 7858 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check for divisibility by 5:  
7858 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check for divisibility by 7:  
To check for divisibility by 7, we can use the following method:  
Double the last digit (8) and subtract it from the number formed by the rest of the digits (785):  
785 - (2*8) = 785 - 16 = 769  
769 is not divisible by 7, so 7858 is not divisible by 7.

Since 7858 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, and we could continue checking other small primes, we can conclude that 7858 is a composite number and not a prime number.

Let's calculate √3661:

√3661 ≈ 60.5

Now, we will check if 3661 is divisible by any numbers between 2 and 60.

Step 2: Perform divisibility tests for numbers from 2 to 60.

When checking divisibility by small prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, etc., we can quickly see that 3661 is not divisible by any of them.

Step 3: Continue checking divisibility by numbers closer to 60.

Yes, 1897 is a prime number. It has only two factors, 1 and 1897, making it divisible only by 1 and itself.
###
To determine if 1897 is a prime number, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if 1897 is divisible by any number from 2 to √1897 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).
   - √1897 ≈ 43.56, so we will check divisibility by numbers from 2 to 44.

2. Check the divisibility of 1897 by each number from 2 to 44.

After checking, we find that 1897 is not divisible by any number from 2 to 44 except for 1 and 1897. This means that 1897 is only divisible by 1 and itself, making it a prime number.

Yes, let's think step by step to determine if 1897 is a composite number.

1. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two factors (1 and itself). 
2. To determine if 1897 is a composite number, we need to find its factors. 
3. The factors of 1897 are the numbers that divide evenly into 1897 without leaving a remainder. 
4. We can start by checking if 2 is a factor of 1897. Since 1897 is odd, we know it's not divisible by 2. 
5. Next, we can check if 3 is a factor of 1897. If we add the digits of 1897 (1+8+9+7 = 25) and the result is divisible by 3, then 3 is a factor of 1897. In this case, 25 is not divisible by 3, so 3 is not a factor of 1897. 
6. We can continue checking higher numbers as factors, but based on this information, we can already conclude that 1897 is not divisible by any other number except 1 and itself. 
7. Since 1897 does not have any factors other than 1 and 1897 itself, we can conclude that 1897 is a prime number, not a composite number. 

Therefore, 1897 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.

The factors of 1673 are: 1, 19, 29, 59, 551, 1673.

Since 1673 has factors other than 1 and itself (19, 29, 59, 551), it is not a prime number.
###
Sure, let's determine if 1673 is a prime number step by step.

Step 1: Check for divisibility by 2 
Since 1673 is an odd number, we can skip checking for divisibility by 2.

Step 2: Check for divisibility by odd numbers up to the square root of 1673
To check for divisibility by odd numbers, we can start with 3 and go up to the square root of 1673, which is approximately 40.88.

Checking for divisibility by odd numbers:
1673 ÷ 3 = 557.67 (Not a whole number)
1673 ÷ 5 = 334.6 (Not a whole number)
1673 ÷ 7 = 239 (Not a whole number)
1673 ÷ 11 = 152.09 (Not a whole number)
1673 ÷ 13 = 128.69 (Not a whole number)
1673 ÷ 17 = 98.41 (Not a whole number)
1673 ÷ 19 = 88.05 (Not a whole number)
1673 ÷ 23 = 72.74 (Not a whole number)
1673 ÷ 29 = 57.69 (Not a whole number)
1673 ÷ 31 = 53.97 (Not a whole number)
1673 ÷ 37 = 45.22 (Not a whole number)

Since 1673 is not divisible by any of the odd numbers up to the square root of 1673, we can conclude that 1673 is a prime number.

Therefore, 1673 is a prime number.

###
Yes, 1673 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

Let's find its factors to confirm: 

1. Start by dividing 1673 by 2. Since 2 is not a factor of 1673 (1673 is odd), we move to the next possible factor.
2. Next, divide 1673 by 3. Again, 3 is not a factor of 1673.
3. Continuing this process, we find that 1673 is divisible by 23.
4. So, 1673 can be expressed as the product of 23 and 73, i.e., 23 x 73.
5. Since 23 is not equal to 1 or 1673, and 73 is not equal to 1 or 1673, we have shown that 1673 is a composite number because it can be divided by factors other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, 1673 is a composite number.

2. Check divisibility by 3: Sum the digits of 4054: 4 + 0 + 5 + 4 = 13, which is not divisible by 3. 

3. Check divisibility by 5: 4054 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check divisibility by 7: You can apply the divisibility rule for 7, which involves subtracting twice the last digit from the rest of the number:

  405 - (2 * 4) = 405 - 8 = 397
 
 Since 397 is not divisible by 7, 4054 is not divisible by 7.

5. Check divisibility by 11: The alternating sum method can be used to test for divisibility by 11, but it's not easily applicable for larger numbers like 4054. 

6. Check divisibility by other prime numbers higher than 11: 4054 is not obviously divisible by any other small prime numbers.

From the above steps, we can see that 4054 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 2.

To do this, we can start by checking the divisibility of 4054 by the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on up to the square root of 4054 (which is approximately 63.64).

If we find any number that divides 4054 without leaving a remainder, then we can conclude that 4054 is a composite number.

Let's start by checking the divisibility of 4054 by 2:
4054 ÷ 2 = 2027 (not a whole number)

Next, let's check the divisibility by 3:
4054 ÷ 3 = 1351.33 (not a whole number)

Continuing this process, we find that 4054 is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or any other smaller prime numbers.

Next, we check if 3 is a factor of 2315. By adding up the digits of 2315 (2 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 11), we see that 3 is not a factor.

Now, we check if 5 is a factor of 2315. Since 2315 ends with 5, 5 is a factor of 2315.

We continue this process until we reach the square root of 2315 because any factor of a number greater than its square root would already have a corresponding factor that is less than the square root.

By finding the factors of 2315, we see that it has factors other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.

###
To determine if 3646 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check if it is divisible by 2.
3646 is an even number because it ends in 6, which means it is divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check if it is divisible by 3.
3 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 19, which is not divisible by 3.
Therefore, 3646 is not divisible by 3.

Step 3: Check for other factors.
To exhaustively check for other factors, we would have to check divisibility by numbers larger than the square root of 3646. 

Let's calculate the square root of 3646:
√3646 ≈ 60.38

We can stop checking for factors after 60 because if there are any factors larger than 60, they would have a corresponding factor smaller than 60.

Since we've already established that 3646 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.

Therefore, the number 3646 is not a prime number, as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

Since 2953 is not a whole number, we move on to the next prime number, which is 3. 

5906 ÷ 3 = 1968.666...

Again, this is not a whole number, so we continue checking with the next prime number, which is 5.

5906 ÷ 5 = 1181.2

As this is also not a whole number, we keep going with the next prime number, which is 7.

5906 ÷ 7 = 843.714...

Since we have not found a whole number divisor up to this point, we continue the process to check other prime numbers until we find a divisor or reach the square root of 5906.

Proceeding with the same steps, we find that 71 is a divisor of 5906.

5906 ÷ 71 = 83

Since 3459 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself. And since 3459 is divisible by 3, it does not meet the definition of a prime number.
###
Yes, 3459 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Sure, let's break it down step by step to determine if 3459 is a composite number.

1. First, we need to identify the factors of 3459. Factors are the numbers that can be multiplied together to get the original number.

2. We start by dividing 3459 by 2, which is the smallest prime number.
3459 ÷ 2 = 1729.5 
Since 1729.5 is not a whole number, 2 is not a factor of 3459.

3. Next, we divide 3459 by 3, another prime number.
3459 ÷ 3 = 1153 
Since 1153 is not a whole number, 3 is also not a factor of 3459.

4. Continuing this process, we try dividing 3459 by 4, 5, and so on until we reach a number greater than √3459.

5. However, we find that no smaller whole number than the square root of 3459 gives an even quotient when divided into 3459. This means that 3459 cannot be expressed as the product of two smaller whole numbers other than 1 and itself.

Therefore, since 3459 cannot be divided evenly by any other numbers except for 1 and itself, we can conclude that 3459 is a prime number.
