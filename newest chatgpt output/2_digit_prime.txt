Yes, 89 is a prime number because it has only two factors: 1 and 89.
###
Sure, let's think step by step:

1. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

2. To determine if 89 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and 89.

3. The factors of 89 are 1 and 89. There are no other factors that divide evenly into 89.

4. Since 89 has only two factors (1 and 89) and no other positive divisors, 89 is a prime number.

Therefore, 89 is a prime number.
###
No, 89 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it has only two factors - 1 and 89.
###
Sure, let's break it down step by step to determine if 89 is a composite number.

1. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that can be divided by more than just 1 and itself.

2. To determine if 89 is a composite number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 89.

3. Let's try to divide 89 by numbers other than 1 and 89 to see if it leaves a whole number result:

- If we try to divide 89 by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, we see that it does not result in a whole number. 
- Similarly, if we try to divide 89 by any number up to 88, we find that it does not have any other integer divisors.

4. Since 89 only has 1 and 89 as divisors, it does not have any other divisors. Therefore, 89 is not divisible by any other number, making it a prime number rather than a composite number.

In conclusion, 89 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.
###
Yes, 97 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 97.
###
Sure, let's determine if 97 is a prime number step by step:

1. First, we need to check if 97 is greater than 1. Since 97 is greater than 1, we can continue.

2. Next, we need to check if 97 is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. We can do this by dividing 97 by all numbers from 2 to the square root of 97, which is approximately 9.85.

3. Let's check if 97 is divisible by any number from 2 to 9. The closest whole numbers we can use for this are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.

   - 97 ÷ 2 = 48.5 (not a whole number)
   - 97 ÷ 3 = 32.33 (not a whole number)
   - 97 ÷ 4 = 24.25 (not a whole number)
   - 97 ÷ 5 = 19.4 (not a whole number)
   - 97 ÷ 6 = 16.16 (not a whole number)
   - 97 ÷ 7 = 13.85 (not a whole number)
   - 97 ÷ 8 = 12.13 (not a whole number)
   - 97 ÷ 9 = 10.77 (not a whole number)

4. Since none of the divisions yield whole numbers other than 1 and 97, we can conclude that 97 is only divisible by 1 and 97 itself.

Therefore, 97 is a prime number because it has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and 97.
###
No, 97 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it has only two factors: 1 and 97.
###
Yes, I can help with that. 
A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that can be divided by at least one other positive integer, other than 1 and itself. 
For the number 97, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and 97 itself. 
We can start by checking divisibility by numbers less than 97: 
- It is not divisible by 2 (97 is odd). 
- It is not divisible by 3 (9+7 = 16 is not a multiple of 3). 
- It is not divisible by 4 (last two digits are not multiples of 4). 
- It is not divisible by 5 (does not end in 0 or 5). 
- It is not divisible by 6 (not divisible by 2 and 3). 
- It is not divisible by 7 (97 is not a multiple of 7). 
- It is not divisible by 8 (doesn't end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8). 
- It is not divisible by 9 (9+7 = 16 is not a multiple of 9). 
- It is not divisible by 10 (doesn't end in 0). 

Since 97 has no factors other than 1 and 97 itself, it is a prime number, not a composite number.
