No, 2 is not a composite number. It is a prime number.
###
Sure, let's work through it step by step.

Firstly, let's define what is a composite number. A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself.

Now, let's look at the number 2. The factors of 2 are 1 and 2. Since 2 has only 2 factors (1 and 2) and both of them are positive, it meets the definition of a composite number.

Therefore, 2 is not a composite number, it is a prime number. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has only 2 positive divisors, 1 and itself.

Yes, 3 is a prime number. It is only divisible by 1 and 3, making it a prime number.
###
Yes, I'd be happy to help you work through this question step by step.

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself.

Step 1: Check if 3 is greater than 1. Since 3 is greater than 1, it satisfies the first condition for being a prime number.

Step 2: Check if 3 has any divisors other than 1 and itself. For 3, the only divisors are 1 and 3. Since 3 only has two divisors, it meets the second condition for being a prime number.

Therefore, based on these two conditions, 3 is indeed a prime number.

Sure! To determine if 7 is a prime number, we need to remember that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

1. Let's check the divisibility of 7 by numbers from 2 to 6. 
   7 is not divisible by 2 (7 ÷ 2 = 3 with a remainder of 1)
   7 is not divisible by 3 (7 ÷ 3 = 2 with a remainder of 1)
   7 is not divisible by 4 (7 ÷ 4 = 1 with a remainder of 3)
   7 is not divisible by 5 (7 ÷ 5 = 1 with a remainder of 2)
   7 is not divisible by 6 (7 ÷ 6 = 1 with a remainder of 1)

Since 7 is not divisible by any numbers other than 1 and 7 itself, we can conclude that 7 is a prime number.
###

Sure, let's break it down step by step.

Composite numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that have at least one factor other than 1 and itself. In other words, composite numbers are numbers that can be divided evenly by numbers other than 1 and the number itself.

Now, let's look at the number 7. The factors of 7 are 1 and 7. Since 7 only has two factors (1 and 7) and cannot be divided evenly by any other number, it is not a composite number.

Therefore, 7 is not a composite number. It is a prime number because it only has two factors: 1 and 7.
###
No, 2 is a prime number.
###
Sure! To determine if 2 is a prime number, let's start by defining what a prime number is.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

In the case of 2:
- 2 is a natural number (it is a positive integer).
- 2 is greater than 1.
- The only positive divisors of 2 are 1 and 2 itself.

Since 2 only has two divisors (1 and 2), and both of them are positive, 2 meets the definition of a prime number.

Therefore, yes, 2 is a prime number.
###

1. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two positive divisors. So, let's find the divisors of 2.

2. The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. Since 2 has only two positive divisors (1 and 2), it does not have more than two divisors.

3. Therefore, since 2 has only two divisors, it is not a composite number. Instead, it is a prime number because it has exactly two positive divisors.

So, in conclusion, 2 is not a composite number; it is a prime number.
###
