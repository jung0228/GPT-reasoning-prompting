542 = 2 x 271 
Therefore, 542 is not divisible only by 1 and itself, making it a composite number.
###
Sure! To determine if 542 is a prime number, we need to follow these steps:

1. Check if the number is divisible by 2. 
    - 542 is even because it ends in 2, so it is divisible by 2.

2. Check if the number is divisible by any odd numbers up to the square root of 542.
    - The square root of 542 is approximately 23.3.
    - Try dividing 542 by all prime numbers up to 23:

        - 542 ÷ 5 = 108.4 (not an integer)
        - 542 ÷ 7 = 77.43 (not an integer)
        - 542 ÷ 11 = 49.27 (not an integer)
        - 542 ÷ 13 = 41.69 (not an integer)
        - 542 ÷ 17 = 31.88 (not an integer)
        - 542 ÷ 19 = 28.53 (not an integer)
        - 542 ÷ 23 = 23.65 (not an integer)

###
Yes, I'd be happy to walk you through the process of determining if 579 is a composite number step by step.

First, let's understand what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two distinct positive divisors. In other words, a composite number has factors other than 1 and itself.

To check if 579 is a composite number, we need to find all its factors. We can start by dividing 579 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. 

If we divide 579 by 2, we get 289 with a remainder of 1. This tells us that 2 is not a factor of 579. As a result, we can try the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

Dividing 579 by 3, we get 193 with a remainder of 0. This means that 3 is a factor of 579. So, we have found two factors of 579: 3 and 193.

Since 579 has factors other than 1 and itself (3 and 193), we can conclude that 579 is a composite number.

Therefore, the number 579 is a composite number.

3. We can start by checking if 218 is divisible by 2, which is the smallest prime number greater than 1.
4. 218 divided by 2 is equal to 109. Since 218 can be divided exactly by 2 and also by 109, it is not a prime number.
5. Therefore, 218 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and itself.

I hope this step-by-step explanation helped you understand why 218 is not a prime number. Let me know if you have any more questions.
###
Yes, 218 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. In this case, the factors of 218 are 1, 2, 109, and 218.
###
Sure! To determine if 218 is a composite number, we first need to understand what a composite number is. A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two factors, meaning it can be divided by more than just 1 and itself.

Now, let's look at the number 218. To determine if it is a composite number, we need to find its factors. The factors of 218 are the numbers that can divide evenly into 218 without leaving a remainder.

Let's start with the simplest pair of factors: 1 and 218. Since 1 and 218 are both factors of 218, we know that 218 is divisible by 1 and 218 itself.

Next, we need to check if there are any other pairs of factors for 218. We can do this by finding the prime factorization of 218.

218 divided by 2 equals 109. Since 109 is a prime number, we cannot divide 218 further by a whole number.

Therefore, the factors of 218 are 1, 2, 109, and 218. Since 218 has more than two factors (1, 2, 109, 218), it is a composite number.

In conclusion, 218 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.

###
Sure, let's determine if 745 is a prime number step by step.

Firstly, we need to check if 745 has any factors other than 1 and itself.

We can start by checking if 2 is a factor of 745. Since 745 is an odd number, 2 cannot be a factor of 745.

Next, let's check if 3 is a factor of 745. The sum of the digits of 745 is 7 + 4 + 5 = 16, which is not divisible by 3. So, 3 is not a factor of 745.

Now, let's check for higher prime numbers like 5. 745 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Continuing this process, we can check if 7 is a factor of 745. By performing the division 745 ÷ 7, we find that it results in a remainder, so 7 is also not a factor of 745.

Similarly, we can continue checking for other prime numbers. But since 745 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, we can conclude that 745 is indeed a prime number.

###
Sure, let's check if 746 is a composite number step by step.

1. First, we need to find at least two factors of the number 746 other than 1 and 746 itself.

2. We can start by dividing 746 by 2. If 746 is divisible by 2, then 2 is a factor of 746.

746 ÷ 2 = 373

Since 746 is not divisible by 2, we move on to the next possible factor.

3. Next, we can try dividing 746 by 3. If 746 is divisible by 3, then 3 is a factor of 746.

746 ÷ 3 = 248.67

Since 746 is not divisible by 3, we continue to the next possible factor.

4. We continue testing with the next integers to see if any of them are factors of 746. If we cannot find any factors other than 1 and 746 itself, then 746 is a prime number.

After going through these steps, we can conclude that 746 is not a prime number as it has factors other than 1 and 746 itself. Therefore, 746 is a composite number.

2. Check if the number is divisible by any odd numbers from 3 to the square root of 235 (approximately 15.33). We start from 3 and check all odd numbers up to 15 since 235 is not divisible by 2.

If 235 is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number. Let's perform the divisibility test:

235 is not divisible by 3 (as the sum of the digits 2+3+5=10, which is not divisible by 3)
235 is not divisible by 5 (as it does not end in 0 or 5)
235 is not divisible by 7
235 is not divisible by 11
235 is not divisible by 13

Since 235 is not divisible by any numbers between 2 and √235, we can conclude that 235 is a prime number.

To determine whether 237 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any factors other than 1 and itself. 

Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
237 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
To check if 237 is divisible by 3, we add the digits together: 2 + 3 + 7 = 12. Since the sum of the digits is divisible by 3, 237 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, 237 is not a prime number since it is divisible by 1, 3, 79, and 237.
###
Yes, 237 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
To determine whether 237 is a composite number, we need to check if it has factors other than 1 and itself. 

First, we can start by checking if any of the numbers from 2 to the square root of 237 (approximately 15.4) divide 237 evenly. If we find any such numbers, then 237 is a composite number. 

Let's check if any numbers from 2 to 15 divide 237 evenly:

237 ÷ 2 = 118.5 (not a whole number)
237 ÷ 3 = 79 (not a whole number)
237 ÷ 4 = 59.25 (not a whole number)

237 ÷ 12 = 19.75 (not a whole number)
237 ÷ 13 = 18.2 (not a whole number)
237 ÷ 14 = 16.928... (not a whole number)
237 ÷ 15 = 15.8 (not a whole number)

Since none of the numbers from 2 to 15 divide 237 evenly, and 237 is not divisible by any whole number other than 1 and 237 itself, we can conclude that 237 is a prime number. 

Therefore, 237 is a prime number, not a composite number.

758 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

2. Check if 758 is divisible by 3:
To check if 758 is divisible by 3, we sum the digits of 758: 7 + 5 + 8 = 20
20 is not divisible by 3, so 758 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check other factors up to the square root of 758:
Since 758 is divisible by 2, we can eliminate all even numbers as factors. We will check the odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of 758.

To do this, we can start by finding the prime factors of 758. We can start by dividing 758 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

758 ÷ 2 = 379

Next, we check if 379 is a prime number. We can try dividing it by prime numbers up to √379 ≈ 19.46 (since if a number n is not divisible by any number p <= √n, then n is prime).

379 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19. Therefore, 379 is a prime number.

Since 758 has factors other than 1 and itself (2 and 379), it is a composite number.

No, 291 is not a prime number. It can be factored as 3 x 97.
###
Sure, let's analyze if 291 is a prime number step by step.

1. First, we need to check if 291 is divisible by 2, the smallest prime number. Since 291 is an odd number, we can eliminate 2 as a divisor.

2. Next, let's check divisibility by other small prime numbers:
- 291 is not divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (2+9+1 = 12) is not divisible by 3.
- 291 is not divisible by 5 because it doesn't end with 0 or 5.

3. Now, we can proceed by checking if 291 is divisible by other numbers. We can use a trial division method and try dividing 291 by prime numbers starting from 7 and going up.

Let's check if 291 is divisible by 7:

\(291 ÷ 7 = 41\)

Since 291 is divisible by 7 without leaving a remainder, 291 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 7.

2. To determine if 291 is a composite number, we need to find its factors by dividing 291 by smaller numbers starting from 2.

3. We can start by dividing 291 by 2, and we see that 291 is not divisible by 2 as there is a remainder. Hence, 291 is not divisible by 2.

4. Next, we can try dividing 291 by 3. By performing the division, we find that 291 is divisible by 3, and 291 divided by 3 equals 97.

5. Since 291 can be divided by 3 and the result is 97, which is greater than 1, we see that 291 has factors other than 1 and itself (291). Therefore, 291 is a composite number.

Thus, 291 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself, specifically 3 and 97.

###
No, 295 is not a prime number. 

295 can be divided by 1, 5, 59, and 295, so it has factors other than 1 and itself, making it a composite number.
###
Sure! To determine if a number is a prime number, we need to check if it has only two positive divisors: 1 and the number itself. 

First, we find the factors of 295 by dividing it by each integer from 1 to the square root of 295 (rounded up to the nearest whole number).

√295 ≈ 17.17

Now we check the divisibility of 295 by numbers from 2 to 17:

295 ÷ 2 = 147.5 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 3 = 98.33 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 4 = 73.75 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 5 = 59 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 6 = 49.17 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 7 = 42.14 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 8 = 36.88 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 9 = 32.78 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 10 = 29.5 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 11 = 26.82 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 12 = 24.58 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 13 = 22.69 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 14 = 21.07 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 15 = 19.67 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 16 = 18.44 (not a whole number)
295 ÷ 17 = 17.35 (not a whole number)

Since none of the divisions result in a whole number, we conclude that 295 has only two positive divisors: 1 and 295. Therefore, 295 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 295 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
###
Sure! 

To determine if 295 is a composite number, we need to follow these steps:
1. Check if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.
2. Calculate the square root of 295 and round it to the nearest whole number.

Let's start with step 1:
295 can be divided by 5, which equals 59. Therefore, 295 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself.

Now, let's move on to step 2:
The square root of 295 is approximately 17.17.
Rounding up, the nearest whole number is 18.

Since 295 can be divided evenly by a number other than 1 and itself (in this case, 5), and the rounded square root is not a prime number, we can conclude that 295 is a composite number.

1. First, we know that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. Check if 298 is divisible by 2: 298 is even because it ends with an 8, so it is divisible by 2.
3. Check if 298 is divisible by 3: The sum of the digits of 298 is 2 + 9 + 8 = 19, which is not divisible by 3, so 298 is not divisible by 3.
4. Check if 298 is divisible by any prime number less than its square root: The prime numbers less than the square root of 298 (approximately 17.26) are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We have already checked 2 and 3, so we need to check 5, 7, 11, and 13. Since 298 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, 298 is not divisible by any prime number less than its square root.
5. Therefore, 298 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.

So, 298 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 2.
###

4. By performing the division, we find that 309 ÷ 3 = 103. Therefore, 309 is divisible by 3.

5. Since 309 can be divided by 3, it is not a prime number. Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have only two factors - 1 and the number itself.

In conclusion, 309 is not a prime number because it has factors other than 1 and 309.

4 + 5 + 4 = 13
13 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check if 454 is divisible by 5:
454 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check if 454 is divisible by 7:
To check divisibility by 7, we can use the divisibility rule for 7 which states that if you double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number, and the result is divisible by 7, then the original number is divisible by 7.
4 - 2(4) = 4 - 8 = -4
45 - 2(4) = 37
37 is not divisible by 7.
Therefore, 454 is not divisible by 7.

###
Sure, let's determine if 505 is a prime number step by step.

1. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. To check if 505 is a prime number, we can start by dividing it by the prime numbers less than its square root, which is approximately 22.47.

3. Let's check the divisibility of 505 by the prime numbers less than 22.47:

- 505 is not divisible by 2, as it is not an even number.
- 505 is not divisible by 3, since the sum of its digits (5+0+5=10) is not divisible by 3.
- 505 is not divisible by 5, as it does not end in 0 or 5.
- 505 is not divisible by 7, as there is no simple divisibility rule for 7 and we can see that 505 is not a multiple of 7.

4. Since we have checked the prime numbers less than the square root of 505 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 505 is not a prime number.

Therefore, 505 is not a prime number as it has divisors other than 1 and itself.

###
Yes, let's think step by step to determine if 505 is a composite number.

To determine if a number is composite, we need to find at least two factors other than 1 and the number itself.

The factors of 505 can be found by dividing it by different numbers starting from 2:
505 ÷ 2 = 252.5 (not a whole number)
505 ÷ 3 = 168.333... (not a whole number)
505 ÷ 4 = 126.25 (not a whole number)
505 ÷ 5 = 101 (whole number)

We have found one factor pair: 5 and 101. Since 5 and 101 are both factors of 505 and they are not 1 and 505, this confirms that 505 is a composite number.

So, yes, 505 is a composite number.

511 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check if 511 is divisible by any prime numbers less than the square root of 511:
The square root of 511 is approximately 22.6. We can try dividing 511 by the prime numbers less or equal to 22:
511 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23.

Since 511 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, we can conclude that 511 is a prime number.

Therefore, 511 is a prime number.
###
Yes, 511 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself. It can be expressed as 7 x 73.
###
To determine if 511 is a composite number, we first need to understand what a composite number is. 

A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has more than two positive divisors. In other words, a composite number is any natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number.

To check if 511 is a composite number, we need to find its factors. Since 511 is not a very small number, we can start by dividing it by small prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. to see if it has any factors.

Let's begin by checking if 511 is divisible by 2, the smallest prime number:
511 ÷ 2 = 255.5

Since 511 is not divisible by 2, let's try the next prime number, 3:
511 ÷ 3 = 170.3333...

Since 511 is not divisible by 3, let's try the next prime number, 5:
511 ÷ 5 = 102.2

Since 511 is not divisible by 5, let's try the next prime number, 7:
511 ÷ 7 = 73

Here, we see that 511 is only divisible by 7 and 73. Since 511 has more than two positive divisors (1, 7, 73, and 511), it is indeed a composite number.

Therefore, 511 is a composite number.
